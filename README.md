# 🔥 Spark

**Spark** is a new kind of social media app built around **ephemeral communities** — short-lived groups where people connect authentically without the pressure of permanent profiles.  

Instead of chasing followers or curating a perfect feed, Spark lets you join or create temporary groups based on **events, places, moods, or goals**. After 24 hours, the community dissolves — leaving only the memories of real connections.

## ✨ Why Spark?
- **No Pressure:** No likes, follower counts, or clout chasing.  
- **Authentic:** People share freely when the spotlight isn’t permanent.  
- **In the Moment:** Join conversations that matter *right now*.  
- **Temporary by Design:** Groups auto-expire after 24 hours.  

---

## 🚀 Core Features
- 🔑 **Auto-Expiry**: Communities vanish after 24 hours.  
- 🌍 **Location-Aware**: Discover groups near you in real time.  
- 🎭 **Flexible Identity**: Post anonymously or with your handle.  
- 🧩 **Icebreakers**: Built-in games and prompts to spark conversations.  
- 📡 **Live Vibe**: Feeds update instantly as people join in.

## 🎯 Use Cases
- “Study grind room” for late-night students  
- “Concert afterparty” for fans who just left a show  
- “Stuck in traffic” group for commuters

## 🛠️ Tech Vision
- **Frontend:** React Native for cross-platform iOS/Android  
- **Backend:** Node.js + WebSocket for real-time chat
